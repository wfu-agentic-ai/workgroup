## Purpose

The WFU Agentic AI Workgroup is a space for faculty and staff to build hands-on skills with command-line AI tools. The goal is practical fluency: by participating, you'll be able to use the terminal, manage files with Git, and work with AI assistants like Claude Code in your own projects.

## Learning goals

By the end of the tutorial sequence, participants will be able to:

1. Navigate the file system and run commands in a terminal
2. Use Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration
3. Configure shell environments and dotfiles
4. Work with Claude Code (and/or other CLI tools) for agentic coding workflows
5. Access and configure APIs for AI services
6. Set up and use MCP servers for tool integration
7. Author reproducible documents with Markdown and Quarto

## Format

- **Weekly meetings** — Brief demos followed by hands-on practice. Meetings are standalone; missing one doesn't block your progress.
- **Async content** — All topics are covered in written tutorials on this site. You can learn entirely at your own pace.
- **Rolling membership** — Join anytime. New participants start with the [CLI basics tutorial](tutorials/cli-basics.qmd) and work forward.
- **Professional development** — Self-assessment prompts in tutorials help you gauge your own progress.

## What you'll need

- **A terminal** — macOS: Terminal.app (built-in) or [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/). Windows: [Windows Terminal](https://aka.ms/terminal) with PowerShell or [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/).
- **A GitHub account** — Sign up free at [github.com](https://github.com/). Faculty can also apply for [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/) benefits, which include Copilot access and private repository extras.
- **A text editor** — [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) recommended (cross-platform), but any editor works.
- **Claude Code** — Installed during an early session. See the [Claude Code docs](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview) for details.
