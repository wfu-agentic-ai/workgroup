# WFU Agentic AI Workgroup

A faculty and staff workgroup at Wake Forest University exploring agentic AI tools in the command-line interface.

## Overview

This workgroup brings together WFU faculty and staff interested in integrating AI-powered CLI tools into their academic workflows. Participants build fluency with the terminal, version control, and agentic coding assistants — starting from zero CLI knowledge and progressing toward independent use of tools like Claude Code, APIs, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.

## Format

- **Meetings:** Weekly, in person at Wake Forest University (day/time TBD based on participant availability) or via Zoom for remote attendees
- **Async content:** Published on the [workgroup website](https://francojc.github.io/wfu-claude-workgroup/)
- **Membership:** Rolling — join anytime
- **Assessment:** None — self-directed exploration with peer support

## Topics covered

- Command-line fundamentals (bash, file system navigation, shell configuration)
- Version control with Git and GitHub
- Claude Code and agentic AI workflows
- API access and configuration
- MCP servers and tool integration
- Markdown and Quarto for reproducible documents
- ... and more based on participant interests and questions

## Getting started

1. Visit the [workgroup website](https://francojc.github.io/wfu-claude-workgroup/) for tutorials and session notes
2. Work through the CLI basics tutorial if you're new to the terminal
3. Attend a weekly session or follow along asynchronously

## Repository purpose

This repo contains the source files for the workgroup's Quarto website. Session materials, tutorials, and resources are authored in Quarto Markdown (`.qmd`) and deployed to GitHub Pages.
