## Welcome

This workgroup brings together Wake Forest University faculty and staff who want to learn how to use agentic AI tools from the command line. We start from scratch — no prior terminal experience required — and work our way toward using tools like Claude Code, APIs, and MCP servers in everyday academic workflows.

## Meeting info

- **When:** Fridays 10:30-11:30am (tentatively)
- **Where:** In person (location TBA)/ or via Zoom (link in calendar invite)
- **Who:** Any WFU faculty or staff member — [join anytime](about.qmd#facilitator)

## Getting started

New to the workgroup? Start here:

1. **[CLI fundamentals](tutorials/cli-fundamentals.qmd)** — Open a terminal and run your first commands
2. **[Working with the filesystem](tutorials/working-with-the-filesystem.qmd)** — Navigate the file system with confidence
3. **[Shell configuration](tutorials/shell-configuration.qmd)** — Customize your terminal environment

Then move on to [version control](tutorials/git-fundamentals.qmd) and [AI tools](tutorials/claude-code-intro.qmd) when you're ready.
