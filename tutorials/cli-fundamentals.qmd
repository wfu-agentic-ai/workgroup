::: {.column width=70%}

This tutorial introduces the {{< glossary CLI >}}. You will learn how to open a {{< glossary terminal >}}, understand the structure of a {{< glossary command >}}, and run a core set of commands for creating, viewing, copying, moving, and deleting files. By the end you will also install {{< glossary Homebrew >}}, a {{< glossary "Package Manager" display="package manager" >}} that you will use throughout the workgroup.

## What is the CLI?

The command-line interface (CLI) is a text-based way to interact with your computer. Instead of clicking on icons and menus, you type commands to perform tasks. The CLI is powerful and efficient, allowing you to automate workflows, manage files, and run programs with precision.

Depending on your operating system, you might use different terminal applications:

- **macOS/Linux:** Terminal (default), iTerm2, or other terminal emulators
- **Windows:** Command Prompt (default), PowerShell, or Windows Terminal

Once you open a terminal, you will see a prompt where you can type commands. The CLI uses a {{< glossary shell >}} (like {{< glossary Bash >}}, {{< glossary Zsh >}}, or PowerShell) to interpret your commands and execute them. By default on macOS, the shell is Zsh, while on Windows, it is Command Prompt. Many Windows users also install Windows Subsystem for Linux ({{< glossary WSL >}}) to access a Linux-like environment with Bash.

::: {.callout-tip}

For most intents and purposes, Zsh and Bash are very similar, and the commands you will learn in this tutorial work in either shell. For the purposes of this workgroup, it is recommended for [Windows users to install/enable WSL and use Ubuntu Linux](https://youtu.be/-Wg2r1lWrTc?si=UDyCV-ky3rng3VCl), as it provides a fully functional Linux system with Bash as the default shell. This will provide a more consistent experience with the tutorials and workgroup sessions.

:::

## Opening a terminal

**macOS**

1. Open Spotlight Search (Cmd + Space)
2. Type "Terminal" and press Enter

**Windows (with WSL Ubuntu)**

1. Open the Start menu (Windows key)
2. Type "Ubuntu" and press Enter

You should see a window with a blinking cursor next to a prompt that looks something like this:

```
jane@macbook ~ %
```

The prompt shows your username, your computer's name, and your current directory. The `%` (Zsh) or `$` (Bash) at the end is the shell's way of saying "I'm ready for a command."

## Anatomy of a command

Before running commands, it helps to know what they look like. Every command follows the same general pattern:

```
command [options] [arguments]
```

- **Command** — the program to run (e.g. `ls`, `mkdir`, `rm`)
- **Options** (also called {{< glossary flag display="flags" >}}) — modify the command's behavior. Short flags start with a single dash and a letter (`-l`); long flags start with two dashes and a word (`--long`). You can usually combine short flags: `-la` is the same as `-l -a`.
- **Arguments** ({{< glossary argument display="arguments" >}}) — the thing(s) the command acts on, usually a file name or directory path

Not every command needs options or arguments. Some commands work fine on their own:

```bash
pwd
```

Others accept options that change the output:

```bash
ls -l
```

And many take both options and arguments:

```bash
ls -la Documents
```

Here `ls` is the command, `-la` combines two flags (`-l` for long format and `-a` for all files including hidden ones), and `Documents` is the argument telling `ls` which directory to list.

::: {.callout-tip}

When you see square brackets in documentation — like `[options]` — they mean that part is optional. You do not type the brackets themselves.

:::

## Your first commands

### Where am I? (`pwd`)

`pwd` stands for "print working directory." It shows you the full path to the directory you are currently in.

```bash
pwd
```

```
/Users/jane
```

This tells you that you are in the user `jane`'s home directory. You will always be somewhere in the filesystem, and `pwd` tells you exactly where.

### What is here? (`ls`)

`ls` lists the files and directories in your current location.

```bash
ls
```

```
Desktop    Documents  Downloads  Pictures
```

Add the `-l` flag for more detail (permissions, size, date):

```bash
ls -l
```

Or combine flags to see hidden files too:

```bash
ls -la
```

### Creating directories (`mkdir`)

`mkdir` creates a new directory.

```bash
mkdir my_folder
```

Verify it was created:

```bash
ls
```

### Moving around (`cd`)

`cd` changes your current directory.

```bash
cd my_folder
```

Confirm where you are now:

```bash
pwd
```

```
/Users/jane/my_folder
```

To go back up one level to the parent directory:

```bash
cd ..
```

::: {.callout-note}

We will cover paths, special symbols like `..` and `~`, and navigation in depth in the [Working with the filesystem](working-with-the-filesystem.qmd) tutorial.

:::

### Creating files (`touch`)

`touch` creates an empty file (or updates the timestamp of an existing file).

```bash
touch my_file.txt
```

```bash
ls
```

```
my_file.txt
```

### Writing to a file (`echo` with `>`)

`echo` prints text to the terminal. Combined with `>`, it writes that text into a file:

```bash
echo "Hello from the CLI" > my_file.txt
```

The `>` operator redirects the output of a command into a file. If the file already exists, `>` overwrites it. To append instead, use `>>`:

```bash
echo "A second line" >> my_file.txt
```

### Viewing file contents (`cat` and `less`)

`cat` prints the entire contents of a file to the terminal:

```bash
cat my_file.txt
```

```
Hello from the CLI
A second line
```

For longer files, `less` is better — it opens the file in a scrollable viewer:

```bash
less my_file.txt
```

Inside `less`, use the arrow keys or Page Up / Page Down to scroll. Press `q` to quit and return to the prompt.

::: {.callout-tip}

`cat` gets its name from "concatenate" — it can combine multiple files: `cat file1.txt file2.txt`. But its most common use is simply viewing a single file.

:::

### Copying files (`cp`)

`cp` copies a file (or directory) from one location to another:

```bash
cp my_file.txt my_copy.txt
```

```bash
ls
```

```
my_copy.txt  my_file.txt
```

Now both files exist. To copy an entire directory and its contents, add the `-r` (recursive) flag:

```bash
cp -r my_folder my_folder_backup
```

### Renaming and moving files (`mv`)

`mv` moves a file to a new location. If the destination is in the same directory, it effectively renames the file:

```bash
mv my_copy.txt renamed_file.txt
```

```bash
ls
```

```
my_file.txt  renamed_file.txt
```

You can also use `mv` to move files between directories:

```bash
mv renamed_file.txt my_folder/
```

### Deleting files and directories (`rm`)

`rm` removes a file permanently:

```bash
rm my_file.txt
```

To remove a directory and everything inside it, add the `-r` flag:

```bash
rm -r my_folder
```

::: {.callout-warning}

`rm` is permanent. There is no trash can, no undo. Double-check what you are deleting before pressing Enter. The `-i` flag makes `rm` ask for confirmation before each deletion: `rm -i file.txt`.

:::

## Navigating your terminal

Beyond typing commands, a few keyboard skills will save you time and frustration.

### Command history

Press the **up arrow** key to cycle through commands you have already run. Press **down arrow** to move forward through history. This is the fastest way to re-run or edit a recent command.

To see your full command history:

```bash
history
```

### Clearing the screen

When your terminal gets cluttered, clear it:

```bash
clear
```

Or press **Ctrl + L** for the same effect.

### Tab completion

Start typing a file name or command and press **Tab** — the shell will complete it for you. If there are multiple matches, press **Tab** twice to see all options.

```bash
ls Doc⟨Tab⟩
```

The shell completes it to `Documents/`. Tab completion works for commands, file names, and directory paths. It is one of the most useful habits to develop early.

::: {.callout-note}

We cover tab completion in more depth in the [Working with the filesystem](working-with-the-filesystem.qmd) tutorial, including navigating deep directory paths with successive tab presses.

:::

### Canceling a command

If a command is running and you want to stop it, press **Ctrl + C**. This sends an interrupt signal that stops most programs immediately.

If you have typed a partial command and want to abandon it without running it, **Ctrl + C** will also clear the current line and give you a fresh prompt.

## Getting help

### Manual pages (`man`)

Most commands have a built-in manual that you can access with `man`:

```bash
man ls
```

This opens a detailed reference for the `ls` command, including all its flags and options. Manual pages can be dense, but they are the authoritative source. Press `q` to exit.

### The `--help` flag

Many commands also accept a `--help` flag that prints a shorter usage summary:

```bash
mkdir --help
```

::: {.callout-tip}

Once you install additional packages via Homebrew, you can also install `tldr` — a community-maintained collection of simplified help pages with practical examples. We will set that up in the [Shell configuration](shell-configuration.qmd) tutorial.

## Installing Homebrew

A {{< glossary "Package Manager" display="package manager" >}} automates installing, updating, and removing software. Instead of downloading installers from the web and clicking through wizards, you run a single command and the package manager handles everything.

{{< glossary Homebrew >}} is the most widely used package manager on macOS, and it also works on Linux (including WSL). You will use it throughout the workgroup to install developer tools, enhanced terminal utilities, and applications.

### Prerequisites

**macOS** — install Apple's command-line developer tools:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

**Windows (WSL Ubuntu)** — install build tools:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install build-essential -y
```

Both commands require your password, since they install system-level software.

### Install Homebrew

Run the official installer:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

::: {.callout-warning}

Always be cautious when running commands that download and execute scripts from the internet. Make sure you trust the source and understand what the script does. Homebrew is widely used and maintained by a large open-source community — the workgroup can vouch for its safety. If you have any questions about running a command, ask a workgroup member.

:::

### Verify the installation

After the installation finishes, confirm it worked:

```bash
brew --version
```

You should see something like `Homebrew 4.x.x`. If the `brew` command is not found, the installer may have printed instructions for adding Homebrew to your PATH — follow those prompts, then open a new terminal window and try again.

::: {.callout-note}

We will cover what {{< glossary PATH >}} is and how to configure it in the [Shell configuration](shell-configuration.qmd) tutorial. For now, just follow any instructions the Homebrew installer provides.

:::

### Install your first package

Try installing `tree`, a command that visualizes directory structures:

```bash
brew install tree
```

```bash
tree -L 1
```

```
.
├── Desktop
├── Documents
├── Downloads
└── Pictures
```

We will use `brew` extensively in the [Shell configuration](shell-configuration.qmd) tutorial to install and configure a full set of recommended tools.
