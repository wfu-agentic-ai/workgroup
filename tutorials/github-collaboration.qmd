## Overview

GitHub hosts Git repositories online and provides tools for collaboration. This tutorial covers connecting your local repository to GitHub, pushing and pulling changes, working with branches, and opening pull requests.

**Prerequisites:** [Git fundamentals](git-fundamentals.qmd)

## What is GitHub?

Git vs GitHub — local version control vs a cloud platform. What GitHub adds: remote hosting, collaboration tools, issue tracking, pull requests.

## Creating a GitHub account

Signing up at github.com. Choosing a username. Setting up a profile.

## Authentication

### The `gh` CLI

Installing the GitHub CLI (`brew install gh`). Authenticating with `gh auth login`. Why this is easier than managing SSH keys or personal access tokens manually.

### Verifying your connection

```bash
gh auth status
```

## Connecting a local repo to GitHub

### Creating a remote repository

Using `gh repo create` or the GitHub web interface. Public vs private repos.

### Adding a remote

What a "remote" is. The `origin` convention.

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo.git
```

### Pushing for the first time

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

What `-u` does (sets upstream tracking).

## Cloning an existing repository

Downloading a repository from GitHub to your computer.

```bash
gh repo clone username/repo
```

When to clone vs when to create from scratch.

## The push/pull workflow

### Pushing changes

Commit locally, then push to GitHub.

```bash
git push
```

### Pulling changes

Downloading changes others have pushed.

```bash
git pull
```

### Handling conflicts

What happens when two people change the same line. Basic conflict resolution.

## Branching basics

### Creating a branch

```bash
git switch -c feature-name
```

Why branches matter: parallel work without affecting `main`.

### Switching branches

```bash
git switch main
git switch feature-name
```

### Merging a branch

```bash
git switch main
git merge feature-name
```

## Pull requests

What a pull request (PR) is. Creating a PR with the `gh` CLI. Reviewing changes. Merging a PR. Why PRs are the standard way to contribute to shared projects.

```bash
gh pr create --title "Add feature" --body "Description of changes"
```

## Forking

What forking is. When to fork vs when to branch. The fork-and-PR workflow for contributing to projects you don't own. Brief overview — this is an advanced topic.

## Practice exercise

Fork the workgroup repository, make a small change, push it, and open a pull request.

## Summary

Table of key commands: `remote add`, `push`, `pull`, `switch`, `merge`, `gh repo clone`, `gh pr create`. Link to next tutorial.
