## Overview

Claude Code is an agentic AI assistant that runs in your terminal. Unlike chat interfaces, it can read files, write code, run commands, and interact with your project directly. This tutorial walks through installation, first use, and strategies for working effectively with an AI coding partner.

**Prerequisites:** [GitHub collaboration](github-collaboration.qmd)

## What is Claude Code?

Agentic AI in the terminal — what "agentic" means (autonomously taking actions, not just answering questions). How Claude Code differs from web-based chat: direct access to your filesystem, Git, and development tools.

## Installation

### Install via npm

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

### Verify installation

```bash
claude --version
```

### Authentication

Signing in with your Anthropic account. API key setup.

## First session

### Starting Claude Code

```bash
claude
```

### The interface

The prompt, how to type requests, reading responses. Exiting a session.

### Basic prompts

Asking Claude Code to explain a file, generate a function, summarize a directory.

## Giving context

### CLAUDE.md files

What `CLAUDE.md` is: a project-specific instruction file that Claude Code reads automatically. Where to place it (project root). What to include: project description, coding conventions, technology stack, constraints.

### Scoped instructions

Global (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`) vs project-level (`./CLAUDE.md`) vs directory-level instructions.

## Working effectively

### Be specific

Vague prompts produce vague results. Compare "fix the bug" vs "the login function in `auth.py` returns `None` when the password is correct — find and fix the issue."

### Review changes

Claude Code proposes changes and asks for approval. Always read what it plans to do before accepting. Use `git diff` afterward to verify.

### Permissions

Claude Code asks before taking actions like editing files or running commands. Understanding the permission model.

## Common workflows

### Generating boilerplate

Scaffolding a new project, creating config files, writing starter templates.

### Debugging

Sharing error messages, pointing Claude Code to the relevant file, iterating toward a fix.

### Documentation

Generating READMEs, docstrings, and comments from existing code.

### Git operations

Using Claude Code to draft commit messages, create branches, open PRs.

## Tips and guardrails

Best practices: start small, iterate, use version control as a safety net. What Claude Code does well and where it needs guidance. Keeping a human in the loop.
