## Overview

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=70%}

This tutorial introduces the command-line interface (CLI). You'll learn how to open a terminal on macOS or Windows, run basic commands, and create, move, and delete files and directories. Furthermore, you'll learn how to install Homebrew, a popular package manager that allows you to easily install and manage software on your system. With Homebrew, you can install a wide range of tools and utilities that can enhance your terminal experience and provide additional functionality.

## What is the CLI?

The command-line interface (CLI) is a text-based way to interact with your computer. Instead of clicking on icons and menus, you type commands to perform tasks. The CLI is powerful and efficient, allowing you to automate workflows, manage files, and run programs with precision.

Depending on your operating system, you might use different terminal applications:

- **macOS/Linux:** Terminal (default), iTerm2, or other terminal emulators
- **Windows:** Command Prompt (default), PowerShell, or Windows Terminal.

Once you open a terminal, you'll see a prompt where you can type commands. The CLI uses a {{< glossary shell >}} (like Bash, Zsh, or PowerShell) to interpret your commands and execute them. By default on macOS, the shell is Zsh, while on Windows, it's Command Prompt. Many Windows users also install Windows Subsystem for Linux ({{< glossary WSL >}}) to access a Linux-like environment with Bash.

::: {.callout-tip}

For most intents and purposes, Zsh and Bash are very similar, and the commands you'll learn in this tutorial will work in either shell. For the purposes of this workgroup, it is recommended for [Windows users to install/enable WSL and use Ubuntu Linux,](https://youtu.be/-Wg2r1lWrTc?si=UDyCV-ky3rng3VCl) as it provides a fully functional Linux system with Bash shell as a default. This will provide a more consistent experience with the tutorials and workgroup sessions.

:::

## Opening a terminal

**macOS**

1. Open Spotlight Search (Cmd + Space)
2. Type "Terminal" and press Enter

**Windows (with WSL Ubuntu)**

1. Open the Start menu (Windows key)
2. Type "Ubuntu" and press Enter

## Running your first commands

Once you have your terminal open, you can start typing commands. Here are a few basic commands to get you started:

Print the current working directory

```bash
pwd
```


List files and directories in the current directory

```bash
ls
```

Create a new directory called "my_folder"

```bash
mkdir my_folder
```

Change into the new directory

```bash
cd my_folder
```

Create a new file called "my_file.txt"

```bash
touch my_file.txt
```

Move the file to a new name "renamed_file.txt"

```bash
mv my_file.txt renamed_file.txt
```

Delete a file

```bash
rm renamed_file.txt
```

Move up one directory level (parent directory)

```bash
cd ..
```

Delete a directory (and all its contents)

```bash
rm -r my_folder
```


### Getting help (inside the terminal)

Most commands have built-in manual that you can access by typing `man` and then the command. For example:

```bash
man ls
```

This will display a list of options and usage information for the `ls` command. There are also help pages for newer commands, in particular those that you may install as part of packages (see [Hombrew](#installing-packages) below). For those, you can typically access help information with the `--help` flag. For example:

```bash
eza --help
```

So, try running the `man` command for some of the commands you just learned, and try using the `--help` flag for any new commands you install with Homebrew.

### Learning more

There are many resources available that document core commands and their usage. Here are a few to get you started:

- [Linux Command Line Basics](https://linuxcommand.org/lc3_learning_the_shell.php)
- [W3Schools: Bash Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/bash/bash_intro.php)

## Installing packages

In addition to the built-in commands, you can also install additional software packages that provide new commands and functionality. On macOS, [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is a popular package manager that allows you to easily install and manage software. On Ubuntu Linux, traditional package managers like `apt` are built-in and provide access to a wide range of software. However, many users prefer to use Homebrew on Linux as well, as it provides a more consistent experience across platforms and often has more up-to-date versions of software.

You may wonder why you might need or want to install additional packages when you can already run commands with the built-in tools. The built-in commands are the bread-and-butter of the CLI, there's no doubt. However, additional packages can provide tools that can enhance your terminal experience in various ways. I'll classify them into four broad categories:

1. **Specialized tools and utilities** that are not included by default. Some of these add software that is commonly used in data science, such as Python, R, or Git. You can find editors like Neovim or Micro or IDEs such as Visual Studio Code (VS Code) or Positron.
2. **Enhanced versions of existing commands** that modernize and improve upon the functionality of built-in commands. Examples include `eza` to replace `ls`, `fd` to replace `find`, `bat` to replace `cat`, and so on. These tools often provide additional features, better performance, and improved user experience compared to their built-in counterparts.
3. **Tools that integrate with other software** to provide additional functionality. For example, you might install a package like `lazygit` that allows you to easily manage your Git repositories from the command line or `ncdu` to analyze disk usage in a more interactive way.
4. **Utilities that enhance the terminal experience** by providing "quality of life" features like improved navigation, better file management, or enhanced command history. Examples include `fzf` for fuzzy finding files and commands, `z` for quickly navigating to frequently used directories, and `thefuck` for correcting mistyped commands.

To install Homebrew (on macOS or Linux), your first need to ensure you have the necessary prerequisites installed.

For macOS users, you will need to run:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

to install the Apple Xcode Command Line Tools before you can use Homebrew. This will provide the necessary compilers and libraries that Homebrew relies on to build and install packages.

Windows users using WSL Ubuntu should run:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

and then

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential -y
```

to install the necessary build tools before installing Homebrew on Linux. This will ensure that you have the compilers and libraries needed for Homebrew to function properly.

In both cases, you will be prompted to enter your password during the installation process, as these commands require administrative privileges to install software on your system.

---

Once you have the prerequisites installed, you can run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

This command downloads and executes a script from the Homebrew repository on GitHub. The script will guide you through the installation process, which may involve entering your password and confirming the installation.

::: {.callout-warning}

**Note:** *Always be cautious when running commands that download and execute scripts from the internet.* Make sure you trust the source and understand what the script does before running it.

This workgroup can vouch for the safety of Homebrew, as it is widely used and maintained by a large community. However, it's always good practice to reach out to members of the workgroup if you have any questions or concerns about running commands or installing software.

:::

After the installation is complete, you may need to add Homebrew to your system's PATH environment variable. If you are given instructions to do so, you can follow the prompts provided by the Homebrew installer.

::: {.callout-note}

The {{< glossary PATH >}} variable, and many others, are defined in your shell's configuration files. Each shell (e.g. Bash or Zsh, for our purpose) has its own set of configuration files where you can set {{< glossary "environment variable" display="environment variables" >}}, {{< glossary alias display="aliases" >}}, and other settings.

A shell's configuration files are typically located in your home directory. From within the terminal, you can move to your home directory with the command `cd ~` (where the tilde `~` is a shortcut for your home directory, e.g. `/Users/username/`, on macOS, or `/home/username` on Linux).

Once you're in your home directory, you can list the files to see the configuration files with `ls -a` (the `-a` flag shows hidden files, which include configuration files that start with a dot).

Users of the Bash shell will typically have a `~/.bashrc` file, while users of the Zsh shell will typically have a `~/.zshrc` file. In addition, there may be another file called `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.zprofile` that is used for login shells. For the purposes of this workgroup, you can typically ignore the login shell configuration files and focus on the `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` files.

If you need to manually add Homebrew to your PATH, choose your shell and run the appropriate command below to add the necessary line to your shell's configuration file.

For Bash (on Linux):

```bash
echo 'eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

For Zsh (on macOS):

```bash
echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

After running the command, you will need to restart your terminal or run `source ~/.bashrc` (for Bash) or `source ~/.zshrc` (for Zsh) to apply the changes.

### Working with `brew`

Once you have Homebrew installed, you can use the `brew` command to install, update, upgrade, and uninstall packages (`formulae`) and applications (`casks`) on your system.

::: {.callout}

**Formulae** are packages that are typically installed in the terminal and provide command-line tools and libraries. Examples include `python`, `git`, `node`, and so on.

**Casks** are packages that are typically installed as applications with a graphical user interface (GUI). Examples include `visual-studio-code`, `google-chrome`, `slack`, and so on.
:::

Here are some common `brew` commands to get you started:

Install a package (formula or cask)

```bash
brew install <package_name> # e.g., brew install r
brew install --cask <package_name> # e.g., brew install --cask visual-studio-code
```

Update Homebrew and all installed packages

```bash
brew update # updates Homebrew itself and the list of available packages
brew upgrade # upgrades all installed packages to their latest versions

# Or you can combine them into one command:

brew update && brew upgrade
```

Uninstall a package

```bash
brew uninstall <package_name> # e.g., brew uninstall r
brew uninstall --cask <package_name> # e.g., brew uninstall --cask visual-studio-code
```

Search for a package

```bash
brew search <package_name> # e.g., brew search claude
```

Find details about a package

```bash
brew info <package_name> # e.g., brew info claude-code
```

List all installed packages

```bash
brew list # lists all installed formulae and casks
```

Homebrew has a vast repository of packages, and you can find many useful tools for the CLI, but as you have seen, you can also use Homebrew to install applications with a GUI --which can be very convenient as you can get updates for those applications through Homebrew all without having to open the application itself.

### Recommended packages

Here are some recommended packages (formuale) to get you started that can bring your terminal experience out of the 80s and into the 21st century:

- `uv`: A modern, fast, and user-friendly Python package manager that simplifies the process of managing Python environments and dependencies.
- `node`: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine that allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser, making it ideal for server-side development and scripting.
- `npm`: The default package manager for Node.js that allows you to install and manage JavaScript packages and dependencies for your projects.
- `zoxide`: A shell extension to navigate your filesystem faster. It keeps track of the directories you visit and allows you to jump to them quickly by name using a fuzzy matching algorithm.
- `thefuck`: A command-line tool that corrects your previous console command. If you mistype a command, you can simply type `fuck` and it will suggest the correct command based on your command history and the error message from the previous command.
- `eza`: A modern replacement for the `ls` command that provides a more colorful and informative output, including file sizes, permissions, and Git status.
- `fd`: A simple, fast, and user-friendly alternative to the `find` command that allows you to search for files and directories with a more intuitive syntax and better performance.
- `bat`: A cat clone with syntax highlighting and Git integration that provides a more visually appealing way to view file contents in the terminal.
- `lazygit`: A simple terminal UI for Git commands that allows you to manage your Git repositories more efficiently without leaving the terminal.
- `ncdu`: A disk usage analyzer with an ncurses interface that provides a visual representation of disk usage, making it easier to identify large files and directories that may be taking up space on your system.
- `yazi`: A terminal-based filesystem viewer and navigator that provides a more interactive way to explore your filesystem, with features like file previews, sorting, and filtering.
- `tldr`: A collection of simplified and community-maintained help pages with practical examples for commands. It does not display the full manual or help pages, but instead provides concise and easy-to-understand explanations for those tools in their user-contributed database.

You can install any of these packages using Homebrew with the command `brew install <package_name>`. For example, to install `zoxide`, you would run:

```bash
brew install zoxide
```

I also recommend adding the following casks to get you started with some useful applications:

- `visual-studio-code`: A popular code editor that provides a powerful and customizable environment for coding, with support for a wide range of programming languages and extensions.
- `iterm2`: A terminal emulator for macOS that provides a more feature-rich and customizable terminal experience, with features like split panes, hotkeys, and a powerful search function.

You can install these applications using Homebrew with the command `brew install --cask <package_name>`. For example, to install Visual Studio Code, you would run:

```bash
brew install --cask visual-studio-code
```

Note, for some packages, you may need to follow additional setup instructions after installation. For example, after installing `zoxide`, you will need to add the following line to your shell's configuration file (`~/.bashrc` for Bash or `~/.zshrc` for Zsh) to enable it:

```bash
eval "$(zoxide init <shell>)"
```
Make sure to replace `<shell>` with your actual shell (e.g., `bash` or `zsh`).

Another example is `eza`, which provides `ls`-like functionality. To use `eza` instead of `ls`, you can create an alias in your shell's configuration file:

```bash
alias ls='eza'
```

This will allow you to use the `ls` command as you normally would, but it will actually run `eza` under the hood, giving you the enhanced features of `eza` while still using the familiar `ls` command.

Aliases, however, can be extended beyond just replacing existing commands. You can create aliases which specify special options for a command that you use frequently. For example, if you want to take advantage of `eza`'s icon support and colorized output every time you list files, you could create an alias like this:

```bash
alias ls='eza --icons=auto --color=auto'
```

You can now build on this alias by adding additional options or flags to that you want to use every time you run `ls`. Furthermore, now the `ls` alias can be used to add any additional options you want to use on a case-by-case basis. For example, if you want to list all files, including hidden files, you can run:

```bash
alias la='ls -a' # uses the `ls` alias and adds the `-a` flag to show hidden files
alias ll='ls -l' # uses the `ls` alias and adds the `-l` flag to show detailed information about files
alias lla='ls -la' # combines both flags to show hidden files with detailed information
```

Using aliases is extremely common in the CLI, and it is highly individualized. You can create aliases for any command and customize them to fit your workflow and preferences. As you start using the CLI more, you'll likely find yourself creating more and more aliases to streamline your commands and make your terminal experience more efficient and enjoyable.

Installing Homebrew and some of these packages may seem like a lot of work, and it is, but it is a one-time setup process with periodic maintenance (e.g., running `brew update && brew upgrade` every few weeks to keep your packages up to date).

To make it easier, you can create a setup script that automates the installation of Homebrew and your preferred packages. This way, if you ever need to set up a new machine or reinstall your system, you can simply run the script to get everything set up quickly.

I've made one available in the workgroup's GitHub repository that installs the recommended packages listed above, along with some additional ones that I find useful. You can run the following command to download and execute the setup script:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wfu-agentic-ai/workgroup/main/setup.sh)"
```





## Conclusion

With Homebrew installed, you can easily install a wide range of tools and utilities that can enhance your terminal experience and provide additional functionality. In the next tutorial, we'll explore some of these tools and how to use them effectively in your workflow.
