## Overview

::: {layout-ncol=2}

This tutorial introduces the command-line interface (CLI). You'll learn how to open a terminal on macOS or Windows, run basic commands, and create, move, and delete files and directories. Furthermore, you'll learn how to install Homebrew, a popular package manager that allows you to easily install and manage software on your system. With Homebrew, you can install a wide range of tools and utilities that can enhance your terminal experience and provide additional functionality.

## What is the CLI?

The command-line interface (CLI) is a text-based way to interact with your computer. Instead of clicking on icons and menus, you type commands to perform tasks. The CLI is powerful and efficient, allowing you to automate workflows, manage files, and run programs with precision.

Depending on your operating system, you might use different terminal applications:

- **macOS/Linux:** Terminal (default), iTerm2, or other terminal emulators
- **Windows:** Command Prompt (default), PowerShell, or Windows Terminal.

Once you open a terminal, you'll see a prompt where you can type commands. The CLI uses a {{< glossary shell >}} (like Bash, Zsh, or PowerShell) to interpret your commands and execute them. By default on macOS, the shell is Zsh, while on Windows, it's Command Prompt. Many Windows users also install Windows Subsystem for Linux ({{< glossary WSL >}}) to access a Linux-like environment with Bash.

::: {.callout-tip}

For most intents and purposes, Zsh and Bash are very similar, and the commands you'll learn in this tutorial will work in either shell. For the purposes of this workgroup, it is recommended for [Windows users to install/enable WSL and use Ubuntu Linux,](https://youtu.be/-Wg2r1lWrTc?si=UDyCV-ky3rng3VCl) as it provides a fully functional Linux system with Bash shell as a default. This will provide a more consistent experience with the tutorials and workgroup sessions.

:::

## Opening a terminal

**macOS**

1. Open Spotlight Search (Cmd + Space)
2. Type "Terminal" and press Enter

**Windows (with WSL Ubuntu)**

1. Open the Start menu (Windows key)
2. Type "Ubuntu" and press Enter

## Running your first commands

Once you have your terminal open, you can start typing commands. Here are a few basic commands to get you started:

Print the current working directory

```bash
pwd
```


List files and directories in the current directory

```bash
ls
```

Create a new directory called "my_folder"

```bash
mkdir my_folder
```

Change into the new directory

```bash
cd my_folder
```

Create a new file called "my_file.txt"

```bash
touch my_file.txt
```

Move the file to a new name "renamed_file.txt"

```bash
mv my_file.txt renamed_file.txt
```

### Getting help (inside the terminal)

Most commands have built-in help that you can access by typing the command followed by `--help` or `-h`. For example:

```bash
ls --help
```

This will display a list of options and usage information for the `ls` command. There are also manual `man` pages for core, built-in commands that provide more detailed documentation. You can access a manual page by typing `man` followed by the command name:

```bash
man ls
```

Note that not all commands have manual pages, but most core commands do. If you encounter a command without a manual page, the `--help` option is usually your best bet for getting information on how to use it.

### Learning more

There are many resources available that document core commands and their usage. Here are a few to get you started:

- [Linux Command Line Basics](https://linuxcommand.org/lc3_learning_the_shell.php)
- [W3Schools: Bash Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/bash/bash_intro.php)

## Installing packages

In addition to the built-in commands, you can also install additional software packages that provide new commands and functionality. On macOS, [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is a popular package manager that allows you to easily install and manage software. On Ubuntu Linux, traditional package managers like `apt` are built-in and provide access to a wide range of software. However, many users prefer to use Homebrew on Linux as well, as it provides a more consistent experience across platforms and often has more up-to-date versions of software.

You may wonder why you might need or want to install additional packages when you can already run commands with the built-in tools. The built-in commands are the bread-and-butter of the CLI, there's no doubt. However, additional packages can provide tools that can enhance your terminal experience in various ways. I'll classify them into four broad categories:

1. **Specialized tools and utilities** that are not included by default. Some of these add software that is commonly used in data science, such as Python, R, or Git. You can find editors like Neovim or Micro or IDEs such as Visual Studio Code (VS Code) or Positron.
2. **Enhanced versions of existing commands** that modernize and improve upon the functionality of built-in commands. Examples include `exa` to replace `ls`, `fd` to replace `find`, `bat` to replace `cat`, and so on. These tools often provide additional features, better performance, and improved user experience compared to their built-in counterparts.
3. **Tools that integrate with other software** to provide additional functionality. For example, you might install a package like `lazygit` that allows you to easily manage your Git repositories from the command line or `ncdu` to analyze disk usage in a more interactive way.
4. **Utilities that enhance the terminal experience** by providing "quality of life" features like improved navigation, better file management, or enhanced command history. Examples include `fzf` for fuzzy finding files and commands, `z` for quickly navigating to frequently used directories, and `thefuck` for correcting mistyped commands.

To install Homebrew (on macOS or Linux), your first need to ensure you have the necessary prerequisites installed.

For macOS users, you will need to run:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

to install the Apple Xcode Command Line Tools before you can use Homebrew. This will provide the necessary compilers and libraries that Homebrew relies on to build and install packages.

Windows users using WSL Ubuntu should run:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

and then

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential -y
```

to install the necessary build tools before installing Homebrew on Linux. This will ensure that you have the compilers and libraries needed for Homebrew to function properly.

In both cases, you will be prompted to enter your password during the installation process, as these commands require administrative privileges to install software on your system.

---

Once you have the prerequisites installed, you can run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

This command downloads and executes a script from the Homebrew repository on GitHub. The script will guide you through the installation process, which may involve entering your password and confirming the installation.

::: {.callout-warning}

**Note:** *Always be cautious when running commands that download and execute scripts from the internet.* Make sure you trust the source and understand what the script does before running it.

This workgroup can vouch for the safety of Homebrew, as it is widely used and maintained by a large community. However, it's always good practice to reach out to members of the workgroup if you have any questions or concerns about running commands or installing software.

:::

After the installation is complete, you may need to add Homebrew to your system's PATH environment variable. If you are given instructions to do so, you can follow the prompts provided by the Homebrew installer.

::: {.callout-note}

The {{< glossary PATH >}} variable, and many others, are defined in your shell's configuration files. Each shell (e.g. Bash or Zsh, for our purpose) has its own set of configuration files where you can set {{< glossary "environment variable" display="environment variables" >}}, {{< glossary alias display="aliases" >}}, and other settings.

A shell's configuration files are typically located in your home directory. From within the terminal, you can move to your home directory with the command `cd ~` (where the tilde `~` is a shortcut for your home directory, e.g. `/Users/username/`, on macOS, or `/home/username` on Linux).

Once you're in your home directory, you can list the files to see the configuration files with `ls -a` (the `-a` flag shows hidden files, which include configuration files that start with a dot).

Users of the Bash shell will typically have a `~/.bashrc` file, while users of the Zsh shell will typically have a `~/.zshrc` file. In addition, there may be another file called `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.zprofile` that is used for login shells. For the purposes of this workgroup, you can typically ignore the login shell configuration files and focus on the `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` files.

If you need to manually add Homebrew to your PATH, choose your shell and run the appropriate command below to add the necessary line to your shell's configuration file.

For Bash (on Linux):

```bash
echo 'eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

For Zsh (on macOS):

```bash
echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

After running the command, you will need to restart your terminal or run `source ~/.bashrc` (for Bash) or `source ~/.zshrc` (for Zsh) to apply the changes.

### Working with `brew`

Once you have Homebrew installed, you can use the `brew` command to install, update, upgrade, and uninstall packages (`formulae`) and applications (`casks`) on your system.

::: {.callout-note}
**Formulae** are packages that are typically installed in the terminal and provide command-line tools and libraries. Examples include `python`, `git`, `node`, and so on.

**Casks** are packages that are typically installed as applications with a graphical user interface (GUI). Examples include `visual-studio-code`, `google-chrome`, `slack`, and so on.
:::

Here are some common `brew` commands to get you started:

Install a package (formula or cask)

```bash
brew install <package_name> # e.g., brew install r
brew install --cask <package_name> # e.g., brew install --cask visual-studio-code
```

Update Homebrew and all installed packages

```bash
brew update # updates Homebrew itself and the list of available packages
brew upgrade # upgrades all installed packages to their latest versions

# Or you can combine them into one command:

brew update && brew upgrade
```

Uninstall a package

```bash
brew uninstall <package_name> # e.g., brew uninstall r
brew uninstall --cask <package_name> # e.g., brew uninstall --cask visual-studio-code
```

Search for a package

```bash
brew search <package_name> # e.g., brew search claude
```

Find details about a package

```bash
brew info <package_name> # e.g., brew info claude-code
```

List all installed packages

```bash
brew list # lists all installed formulae and casks
```

Homebrew has a vast repository of packages, and you can find many useful tools for the CLI, but as you have seen, you can also use Homebrew to install applications with a GUI --which can be very convenient as you can get updates for those applications through Homebrew all without having to open the application itself.
