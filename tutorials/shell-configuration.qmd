## Overview

Every time you open a terminal, your shell reads a set of configuration files before showing you a prompt. These files control how the shell behaves — what shortcuts are available, which programs it can find, and how the prompt looks. This tutorial explains how to edit those files, set environment variables, create aliases, and install a full set of recommended tools with Homebrew.

**Prerequisites:** [Working with the filesystem](working-with-the-filesystem.qmd)

## What are dotfiles?

In the previous tutorial you learned that {{< glossary dotfile display="dotfiles" >}} are hidden files whose names start with a period. Many of the most important dotfiles are *configuration files* — plain text files that programs read at startup to learn your preferences.

Common dotfiles you will encounter:

| File | Used by |
|------|---------|
| `~/.zshrc` | Zsh shell configuration |
| `~/.bashrc` | Bash shell configuration |
| `~/.gitconfig` | Git settings (name, email, editor) |
| `~/.config/` | Directory for application configs |

These files live in your home directory. Because they start with a dot, `ls` hides them unless you use `ls -a`.

## Shell startup files

When you open a terminal, your shell runs a {{< glossary "Startup File" display="startup file" >}} — a script that sets up your environment. Which file it reads depends on your shell:

| Shell | Startup file |
|-------|-------------|
| Zsh (macOS default) | `~/.zshrc` |
| Bash (Linux/WSL default) | `~/.bashrc` |

::: {.callout-note}

You may also see files like `~/.zprofile` or `~/.bash_profile`. These run for *login shells* (the first shell started when you log in). For the purposes of this workgroup, focus on `.zshrc` or `.bashrc` — they handle interactive sessions, which is what you get when you open a terminal window.

:::

### Editing your config file

You can edit your shell config with any text editor. `nano` is a simple terminal-based editor that is available on all systems:

```bash
nano ~/.zshrc
```

Inside `nano`:

- Type or paste text normally
- **Ctrl + O** to save (then press Enter to confirm the filename)
- **Ctrl + X** to exit

If you have Visual Studio Code installed, you can open the file in a graphical editor instead:

```bash
code ~/.zshrc
```

::: {.callout-tip}

Before editing any config file, make a backup:

```bash
cp ~/.zshrc ~/.zshrc.backup
```

If something goes wrong, you can restore it:

```bash
cp ~/.zshrc.backup ~/.zshrc
```

:::

### Applying changes with `source`

After editing your config file, the changes do not take effect automatically — your current shell session already ran the old version at startup. You have two options:

1. Open a new terminal window (it will read the updated file)
2. Use the {{< glossary source >}} command to re-read the file in your current session:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

For Bash users:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Environment variables

{{< glossary "Environment Variable" display="Environment variables" >}} are key-value pairs that programs read to learn about your system and preferences. You can see all current environment variables with:

```bash
env
```

To see the value of a specific variable, use `echo` with a `$` prefix:

```bash
echo $HOME
```

```
/Users/jane
```

### Setting a variable

To create or change an environment variable for the current session:

```bash
MY_NAME="Jane"
echo $MY_NAME
```

```
Jane
```

This variable only exists in your current shell. To make it available to programs you launch *from* this shell, use {{< glossary export >}}:

```bash
export MY_NAME="Jane"
```

To make a variable persist across sessions, add the `export` line to your shell config file (`~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`).

### The PATH variable

{{< glossary PATH >}} is the most important environment variable. It tells the shell where to look for programs when you type a command.

```bash
echo $PATH
```

```
/opt/homebrew/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
```

The output is a list of directories separated by colons. When you type a command like `brew`, the shell searches these directories from left to right until it finds a program with that name. If the program is not in any of the PATH directories, you get a "command not found" error.

This is why the Homebrew installer asked you to add a line to your config file — it needed to put Homebrew's directory (`/opt/homebrew/bin` on macOS, `/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin` on Linux) into your PATH.

### Adding a directory to PATH

To add a directory to PATH, add a line like this to your config file:

```bash
export PATH="/some/new/directory:$PATH"
```

The `$PATH` at the end preserves the existing directories. New directories go at the beginning so they are searched first.

If Homebrew is not working after installation, this is most likely the fix. Add the appropriate line for your system:

For Zsh on macOS:

```bash
echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

For Bash on Linux:

```bash
echo 'eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

Then apply the change:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc   # or source ~/.bashrc
```

### Other useful variables

| Variable | What it stores |
|----------|---------------|
| `HOME` | Your home directory path |
| `EDITOR` | Your preferred text editor (e.g. `nano`, `vim`, `code`) |
| `SHELL` | The path to your current shell program |
| `USER` | Your username |

To set a default editor, add this to your config file:

```bash
export EDITOR="nano"
```

## Aliases

An {{< glossary alias >}} is a shortcut — a custom name for a command or series of commands. You define aliases in your shell config file so they are available every session.

### Creating an alias

The syntax is:

```bash
alias shortcut='command'
```

For example, a shortcut to go up one directory:

```bash
alias ..='cd ..'
```

Now typing `..` at the prompt runs `cd ..`.

### Temporary vs persistent aliases

If you type an alias directly at the prompt, it lasts only until you close the terminal. To make it permanent, add the `alias` line to `~/.zshrc` (or `~/.bashrc`) and run `source` to activate it.

### Alias chaining

An alias can reference another alias. For example, suppose you create a base alias for `eza` (a modern replacement for `ls`) with colorized output:

```bash
alias ls='eza --icons=auto --color=auto'
```

You can then build on it:

```bash
alias la='ls -a'           # all files, including hidden
alias ll='ls -l'           # long format with details
alias lla='ls -la'         # both hidden and detailed
```

Since `la` uses the `ls` alias, it inherits the `--icons=auto --color=auto` flags automatically.

### Practical alias examples

**Navigation:**

```bash
alias ..='cd ..'
alias ...='cd ../..'
alias c='clear'
```

**Safety (ask before overwriting or deleting):**

```bash
alias cp='cp -i'
alias mv='mv -i'
alias rm='rm -i'
```

**Tool replacements (once installed via Homebrew):**

```bash
alias cat='bat'
alias ls='eza --icons=auto --color=auto'
```

Using aliases is highly individualized. As you use the CLI more, you will develop your own collection of shortcuts tuned to your workflow.

## Working with Homebrew

You installed {{< glossary Homebrew >}} in the [CLI fundamentals](cli-fundamentals.qmd) tutorial. Now let's learn how to use it effectively.

### Formulae vs casks

Homebrew distinguishes two types of packages:

- **Formulae** — command-line tools and libraries installed in the terminal (e.g. `python`, `git`, `eza`)
- **Casks** — desktop applications with a graphical interface (e.g. `visual-studio-code`, `iterm2`)

### Common `brew` commands

Install a formula:

```bash
brew install <package_name>
```

Install a cask (desktop app):

```bash
brew install --cask <package_name>
```

Update Homebrew and upgrade all installed packages:

```bash
brew update && brew upgrade
```

::: {.callout-tip}

Run `brew update && brew upgrade` every few weeks to keep your tools current.

:::

Search for a package:

```bash
brew search <query>
```

View details about a package:

```bash
brew info <package_name>
```

List everything you have installed:

```bash
brew list
```

Uninstall a package:

```bash
brew uninstall <package_name>
```

## Recommended packages

Here are packages organized by purpose. Install any of them with `brew install <name>`.

### Development tools

| Package | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `uv` | Fast Python package and environment manager |
| `node` | JavaScript runtime (needed for some tools) |
| `npm` | JavaScript package manager (comes with Node) |

### Enhanced commands

These replace built-in commands with modern alternatives that have better defaults, color output, and additional features.

| Package | Replaces | What it adds |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| `eza` | `ls` | Icons, color, Git status in file listings |
| `bat` | `cat` | Syntax highlighting, line numbers, Git integration |
| `fd` | `find` | Simpler syntax, faster, respects `.gitignore` |

### Navigation and search

| Package | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `zoxide` | Remembers directories you visit; jump to them with `z <partial-name>` |
| `fzf` | Fuzzy finder for files, command history, and more |

### Productivity

| Package | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `thefuck` | Suggests corrections for mistyped commands |
| `tldr` | Simplified help pages with practical examples |
| `ncdu` | Interactive disk usage analyzer |
| `yazi` | Terminal file browser with previews |
| `lazygit` | Terminal UI for Git operations |

### Cask recommendations (macOS)

| Package | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `visual-studio-code` | Popular code editor with extension ecosystem |
| `iterm2` | Feature-rich terminal emulator |
| `wezterm` | Cross-platform, GPU-accelerated terminal |
| `ghostty` | Fast, native terminal emulator |

Install a cask with:

```bash
brew install --cask visual-studio-code
```

::: {.callout-tip title="Windows / WSL users"}

For graphical applications on Windows, install the Windows version directly:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) — install the "Remote - WSL" extension to edit files inside your WSL environment from Windows
- [WezTerm](https://wezterm.org/install/windows.html) — set the default domain to WSL in its config file

Terminal-based formulae (everything except casks) install normally inside WSL via Homebrew.

:::

## Configuring installed tools

Some packages need a line in your shell config to activate. Here are the common ones.

### zoxide

Add to your config file:

```bash
eval "$(zoxide init zsh)"    # for Zsh
eval "$(zoxide init bash)"   # for Bash
```

After sourcing, you can use `z` to jump to directories you have visited before:

```bash
z Documents    # jumps to ~/Documents (or whichever "Documents" you visit most)
```

### thefuck

Add to your config file:

```bash
eval "$(thefuck --alias)"
```

Now, after a mistyped command, type `fuck` and it will suggest the correction.

### eza aliases

To replace `ls` with `eza` everywhere, add these aliases:

```bash
alias ls='eza --icons=auto --color=auto'
alias la='ls --almost-all'
alias ll='ls --long --time-style=relative --ignore-glob=.git'
alias lla='la --long --time-style=relative --ignore-glob=.git'
```

### bat as a pager

To use `bat` for manual pages and as the default pager:

```bash
export MANPAGER="sh -c 'col -bx | bat -l man -p'"
export PAGER="bat"
```

### Worked example

Here is a complete block you could add to the end of your `~/.zshrc` (or `~/.bashrc`, replacing `zsh` with `bash` in the zoxide line):

```bash
# Tool integrations
eval "$(zoxide init zsh)"
eval "$(thefuck --alias)"

# Enhanced defaults
alias ls='eza --icons=auto --color=auto'
alias la='ls --almost-all'
alias ll='ls --long --time-style=relative --ignore-glob=.git'
alias cat='bat'

# Navigation shortcuts
alias ..='cd ..'
alias ...='cd ../..'
alias c='clear'

# Safety
alias cp='cp -i'
alias mv='mv -i'
alias rm='rm -i'

# Pager
export MANPAGER="sh -c 'col -bx | bat -l man -p'"
export PAGER="bat"
```

After adding this block, apply it:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

Then test a few commands:

```bash
ls              # should show icons and color
z ~             # should jump to home
tldr ls         # should show a simplified help page
```

## The setup script

If you prefer to automate the entire process described in this tutorial, the workgroup provides a setup script that installs all recommended packages, configures Git, and appends shell integrations to your config file.

Run it directly:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wfu-agentic-ai/workgroup/main/setup.sh)"
```

Or preview what it would do without making changes:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wfu-agentic-ai/workgroup/main/setup.sh | bash -s -- --dry-run
```

::: {.callout-note}

If you followed this tutorial manually and installed everything yourself, you already have what the script provides. The script is most useful for setting up a new machine quickly or helping someone who wants to skip the step-by-step process.
