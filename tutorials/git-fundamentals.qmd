## Overview

Git is a version control system that records changes to your files over time. Instead of saving multiple copies of a file (`report_v1.txt`, `report_v2_final.txt`, `report_v2_final_FINAL.txt`), Git lets you save snapshots — called *commits* — that you can revisit, compare, or restore at any time. This tutorial covers the core Git workflow: initializing a repository, staging changes, committing, and reviewing history.

**Prerequisites:** [Shell configuration](shell-configuration.qmd)

## What is version control?

Why tracking changes matters. The problem with manual versioning (renaming files). How Git solves this: a timeline of snapshots with descriptions.

## Configuring Git

First-time setup with `git config --global`. Setting your name, email, and default branch name. Verifying with `git config --list`.

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```

::: {.callout-tip}
If you ran the workgroup setup script, Git is already configured. Check with `git config --list`.

## Creating a repository

What `git init` does. Creating a practice project. The hidden `.git/` directory.

```bash
mkdir my-project && cd my-project
git init
```

## The staging area

The three-zone model: working directory, staging area (index), and repository. Why Git uses a staging step (selective commits). Diagram of the flow.

## The core workflow

### Checking status (`git status`)

What the status output tells you: untracked, modified, staged.

### Adding files to staging (`git add`)

Staging specific files vs staging everything. Why `git add .` needs care.

### Committing a snapshot (`git commit`)

Writing a good commit message. The `-m` flag.

```bash
git add file.txt
git commit -m "Add initial draft of file"
```

### Viewing history (`git log`)

Reading the log. Useful flags: `--oneline`, `--graph`.

### Comparing changes (`git diff`)

Seeing what changed before committing. Staged vs unstaged diffs.

## Undoing mistakes

### Unstaging a file (`git restore --staged`)

Removing a file from the staging area without losing changes.

### Discarding changes (`git restore`)

Reverting a file to its last committed state.

### Reverting a commit (`git revert`)

Creating a new commit that undoes a previous one (safe for shared history).

::: {.callout-warning}
`git restore` discards uncommitted changes permanently. Make sure you want to lose those edits before running it.
:::

## Ignoring files (`.gitignore`)

What `.gitignore` does. Common patterns: OS files (`.DS_Store`), editor files, build artifacts. Creating a `.gitignore` file.

## Practice exercise

A guided exercise: create a small project, make several commits, view the log, and undo a change.

## Summary
