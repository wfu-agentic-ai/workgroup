## Overview

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=70%}

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a {{< glossary "Version Control" display="version control" >}} system that records changes to your files over time. Instead of saving multiple copies of a file (`report_v1.txt`, `report_v2_final.txt`, `report_v2_final_FINAL.txt`), Git lets you save snapshots, called {{< glossary Commit display="*commits*" >}}, that you can revisit, compare, or restore at any time. This tutorial covers the core Git workflow: initializing a repository, staging changes, committing, and reviewing history.

Adding a Git repository to your project allows you to track changes to your project at checkpoints. This will allow you to easily revert to a previous state if something goes wrong, or to compare different versions of your project as you iterate. [Claude Code also has built-in support for checkpointing your project](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/checkpointing), however, it is not a substitute for Git.

**Note:** Git and [GitHub](https://github.com/) are not the same thing. Git is the version control system that runs on your computer, while GitHub is a web-based platform for hosting Git repositories and collaborating with others (among others [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/), [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), etc). This tutorial focuses on Git itself; we'll cover web repositories and collaboration in a future tutorial.

## What is version control?

<!-- Why tracking changes matters. The problem with manual versioning (renaming files). How Git solves this: a timeline of snapshots with descriptions. -->

As alluded to in the overview, there is an inherent problem when working with projects in which files and directories are changing over time; how do you keep track of those changes? One common approach is to save multiple versions of a file with different names. However, these, as you know, leads to all sorts of confusion, for yourself and even more so for collaborators.

Furthermore, when working with a tool, such as Claude Code, that allows you to iterate on a project by making changes to files and directories across your project, it can be difficult to keep track of those changes --even if you wanted to-- without a version control system.

A version control system, like Git, allows you to address both issues: 1) it provides a structured way to track changes to your files over time (without renaming them), and 2) it allows you to easily revert to a previous state of your project (or parts of it) if something goes wrong, or to compare different versions of your project as you iterate.

There's some overhead to learning Git, but the benefits are well worth it. Once you get the hang of it, you'll wonder how you ever managed without it.

## Installing Git

Many modern operating systems come with Git pre-installed. Check with `git --version`. However, these versions can be outdated. To get the latest version, use Homebrew[^1]:

[^1]: If you don't have Homebrew installed, see the [CLI fundamentals](cli-fundamentals.qmd#installing-homebrew) for instructions.

```bash
brew install git
```

::: {.callout-tip}
If you ran the workgroup setup script, Git is already configured. Check with `git config --list`.
:::

## Configuring Git

<!-- First-time setup with `git config --global`. Setting your name, email, and default branch name. Verifying with `git config --list`. -->

Before you start using Git, you need to configure it with your name and email, at least. This information is used to identify the author of your commits. While we are at it, we can also set the default branch name to `main`, which is the modern convention (do not worry about branches for now, this is a more advanced topic).

From the terminal, run the following commands, replacing the name and email with your own:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```

Good news, you only need to do this once for a given machine! Git will save this information in a configuration file on your computer, so you won't have to set it again for future projects. You can verify that your configuration is set up correctly with:

```bash
git config --global --list
```

Verify that your name, email, and default branch name are listed in the output.

## Creating a repository

<!-- What `git init` does. Creating a practice project. The hidden `.git/` directory. -->

Now we are ready to create Git repositories for our projects. A Git {{< glossary Repository display="repository" >}} is a special directory that contains all the information about the history of your project, including the commits, branches, and configuration. You can create a Git repository in any directory by running `git init` in that directory.

```bash
cd path/to/your/project
git init
```

This command creates a hidden directory called `.git/` in your project directory. This is where Git stores all the information about your repository, including the commits, branches, and project-specific configuration. You can see this directory with `ls -a`, but you should not modify anything inside it directly.

Once you have initialized a Git repository, Git will start tracking changes to your files. However, it won't automatically log those changes as commits. That's our next step: staging and committing changes.

## The staging area

<!-- The three-zone model: working directory, staging area (index), and repository. Why Git uses a staging step (selective commits). Diagram of the flow. -->

Git uses a three-zone model to manage changes to your files:

1. **{{< glossary "Working Directory" display="Working directory" >}}**: This is where you make changes to your files. It's the actual files and directories you see in your project.
2. **{{< glossary "Staging Area" display="Staging area" >}} (index)**: This is an intermediate area where you can stage changes that you want to include in your next commit. You can think of it as a "to-do list" for your next commit.
3. **{{< glossary Repository >}}**: This is where Git stores the history of your commits. When you commit changes, Git takes a snapshot of the staged changes and saves it in the repository.


Here is the flow:

```{mermaid}
%%| label: fig-staging-areas
%%| fig-cap: "The three zones of Git: working directory, staging area, and repository."
flowchart LR
    subgraph wd["Working Directory"]
        A["Files you<br>edit and save"]
    end
    subgraph sa["Staging Area"]
        B["Changes selected<br>for your next commit"]
    end
    subgraph repo["Repository"]
        C["Permanent history<br>of snapshots"]
    end
    A -- "git add" --> B -- "git commit" --> C
```


## The core workflow

In @fig-staging-areas, we see the overview of the core Git workflow: you make changes to your files in the working directory, then you stage the changes you want to include in your next commit, and finally, you commit those staged changes to the repository. Let's go through each step in more detail.

To do so we will use the following example:

```{mermaid}
%%| label: fig-staging-areas-example
%%| fig-cap: "Example of the three zones of Git with actual files."

flowchart LR
    subgraph wd["Working Directory"]
        direction TB
        w1["notes.txt<br><i>modified</i>"]
        w2["report.qmd<br><i>modified</i>"]
        w3["scratch.txt<br><i>modified</i>"]
        w4["data.csv<br><i>untracked</i>"]
        w5["results.csv<br><i>unmodified</i>"]
    end
    style w5 stroke-dasharray: 5 5
    subgraph sa["Staging Area"]
        direction TB
        s1["notes.txt<br><i>staged</i>"]
        s2["report.qmd<br><i>staged</i>"]
        s3["scratch.txt<br><i>not staged</i>"]
        s4["data.csv<br><i>staged</i>"]
    end
    subgraph repo["Repository"]
        C["Commit:<br><i>'Update notes and report'</i>"]
    end
    w1 -- "git add" --> s1
    w2 -- "git add" --> s2
    w3 --> s3
    w4 -- "git add" --> s4
    s1 --> repo
    s2 -- "git commit" --> repo
    s4 --> repo
```


### Checking status (`git status`)

The `git status` command shows you the current state of your {{< glossary "Working Directory" display="working directory" >}} and {{< glossary "Staging Area" display="staging area" >}}. It tells you which files have been modified, which changes are staged and ready to commit, and which files Git doesn't know about yet. You can run it at any point without changing anything — it's purely informational.

Let's say you just initialized a new repository and created a file called `notes.txt`. Running `git status` gives you:

```bash
git status
```

```text
On branch main

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        notes.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

Git sees `notes.txt` but isn't tracking it yet — it's *untracked*. Once you stage the file with `git add notes.txt` and run `git status` again:

```text
On branch main

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   notes.txt
```

Now `notes.txt` appears under "Changes to be committed" — it's *staged*. After you commit, `git status` reports a clean working tree:

```text
On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

This means every tracked file matches the latest {{< glossary Commit display="commit" >}}. No changes are pending.

::: {.callout-tip}
Run `git status` early and often. It's the safest way to understand what Git sees before you stage or commit anything.
:::

### Adding files to staging (`git add`)

The `git add` command moves changes from the {{< glossary "Working Directory" display="working directory" >}} into the {{< glossary "Staging Area" display="staging area" >}}. You can stage individual files by name:

```bash
git add notes.txt
git add report.qmd
```

Or stage multiple files in one command:

```bash
git add notes.txt report.qmd data.csv
```

Referring back to @fig-staging-areas-example, notice that `scratch.txt` is *not* staged even though it was modified. This is the power of the staging area — you choose exactly which changes go into each commit. Maybe `scratch.txt` contains temporary work you don't want to record yet.

You may see tutorials that use `git add .` (with a dot) to stage everything in the current directory at once. This works, but it can bite you.

::: {.callout-warning}
`git add .` stages *every* change in the current directory, including files you may not intend to commit — temporary files, data files, API keys, or editor backups. Prefer staging files by name so you know exactly what goes into each commit.
:::

### Committing a snapshot (`git commit`)

Once your changes are staged, `git commit` saves a snapshot of those changes as a {{< glossary Commit display="commit" >}} in the {{< glossary Repository display="repository" >}}. Each commit gets a unique identifier (a long hash like `a1b2c3d`), records who made the change and when, and stores the message you provide.

Use the `-m` flag to write your commit message inline:

```bash
git commit -m "Add project notes and initial report"
```

```text
[main 4f3a1b2] Add project notes and initial report
 2 files changed, 24 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 notes.txt
 create mode 100644 report.qmd
```

The output confirms the branch (`main`), an abbreviated commit hash (`4f3a1b2`), and a summary of what changed. If you omit the `-m` flag, Git opens a text editor for you to write the message.

::: {.callout-tip title="Writing good commit messages"}
A good commit message is short (under ~50 characters for the subject line), uses the imperative mood ("Add report" not "Added report"), and describes *why* the change matters rather than just *what* changed. Think of it as a label for a snapshot: if you browse your history later, the messages should tell a clear story.

Bad: `updated stuff`
Good: `Add draft methodology section to report`
:::

::: {.callout-note title="Stuck in a text editor?"}
If Git opens an unfamiliar editor (often Vim), you'll see a screen that doesn't respond to typing as you'd expect. To escape Vim: press `Esc`, then type `:q!` and press `Enter`. To avoid this in the future, always use the `-m` flag, or set a friendlier default editor:

```bash
git config --global core.editor "nano"
```
:::

### Viewing history (`git log`)

The `git log` command shows the history of commits in your repository, starting with the most recent:

```bash
git log
```

```text
commit 4f3a1b2e8d9c0f1a2b3c4d5e6f7a8b9c0d1e2f3a
Author: Your Name <you@example.com>
Date:   Thu Feb 6 10:30:00 2026 -0500

    Add project notes and initial report

commit 1a2b3c4d5e6f7a8b9c0d1e2f3a4b5c6d7e8f9a0b
Author: Your Name <you@example.com>
Date:   Thu Feb 6 10:15:00 2026 -0500

    Initialize project with README
```

Each entry shows the full commit hash, the author, the date, and the message. For a more compact view, use the `--oneline` flag:

```bash
git log --oneline
```

```text
4f3a1b2 Add project notes and initial report
1a2b3c4 Initialize project with README
```

This is often all you need when scanning your project's history. You can also add `--graph` to visualize branch structure — not useful yet with a single branch, but handy once you start working with branches:

```bash
git log --oneline --graph
```

### Comparing changes (`git diff`)

Before you stage or commit, it's often useful to see exactly what changed. The `git diff` command compares versions of your files.

**Unstaged changes** (working directory vs. staging area):

```bash
git diff
```

This shows changes you've made but haven't staged yet. For example, say you edit `notes.txt` and add a new line. Running `git diff` produces output like:

```diff
diff --git a/notes.txt b/notes.txt
index 3b18e51..f3c1a2d 100644
--- a/notes.txt
+++ b/notes.txt
@@ -1,2 +1,3 @@
 Meeting notes from Feb 6
 - Discussed project timeline
+- Assigned tasks to team members
```

Lines starting with `+` were added; lines starting with `-` were removed. The `@@` line tells you which part of the file changed.

**Staged changes** (staging area vs. last commit):

```bash
git diff --staged
```

This shows the changes that are already staged and will go into your next commit. After you run `git add notes.txt`, running `git diff` produces no output (there are no *unstaged* changes left), but `git diff --staged` shows the same diff as before.

## Undoing mistakes

One of Git's biggest benefits is that mistakes are rarely permanent. This section covers three levels of "undo," from lightest to heaviest.

### Unstaging a file (`git restore --staged`)

If you staged a file by accident (say you ran `git add scratch.txt` and didn't mean to), you can remove it from the staging area without losing the changes in your working directory:

```bash
git restore --staged scratch.txt
```

Verify with `git status`:

```text
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   scratch.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" to track)
```

The file is back to *modified but unstaged*. Your edits are still in the file — Git just removed it from the "to be committed" list.

### Discarding changes (`git restore`)

If you made edits to a file and want to throw them away entirely — reverting the file to its state at the last commit — use `git restore` without the `--staged` flag:

```bash
git restore report.qmd
```

After running this, `git status` will no longer show `report.qmd` as modified. The file on disk has been reverted to match the most recent commit.

::: {.callout-warning}
`git restore` discards uncommitted changes permanently. There is no way to get those edits back. Make sure you truly want to lose them before running this command.
:::

### Reverting a commit (`git revert`)

What if the mistake is already committed? You could rewrite history, but that gets complicated and can cause problems if others are working with the same repository. The safer approach is `git revert`, which creates a *new* commit that undoes the changes from a previous one.

For example, say your most recent commit introduced a mistake. You can undo it with:

```bash
git revert HEAD
```

`HEAD` is a shorthand for "the latest commit." Git will create a new commit whose changes are the exact opposite of the reverted commit. Your log will look something like:

```text
a3b4c5d Revert "Add broken config file"
9f8e7d6 Add broken config file
4f3a1b2 Add project notes and initial report
```

The original commit (`9f8e7d6`) stays in history, and the revert commit (`a3b4c5d`) cleanly undoes its effects. This is the safe approach — the history tells the full story of what happened and how it was fixed.

## Ignoring files (`.gitignore`)

Not every file in your project belongs in the {{< glossary Repository display="repository" >}}. Operating system files (`.DS_Store` on macOS), editor temp files, build outputs, large data files, and especially files containing secrets (API keys, passwords) should stay out of your commit history.

Git uses a file called `.gitignore` in the root of your project to define patterns for files and directories it should ignore entirely. Create the file and add one pattern per line:

```bash
nano .gitignore
```

A typical `.gitignore` might look like:

```text
# Operating system files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Editor temporary files
*.swp
*~
.vscode/

# Build artifacts
_site/
_freeze/
*.html

# Data files (too large for version control)
data/*.csv

# Secrets — never commit these
.env
credentials.json
```

Lines starting with `#` are comments. The `*` wildcard matches any sequence of characters, so `*.swp` ignores all files ending in `.swp`. A trailing `/` means "this directory and everything inside it."

Once you save `.gitignore`, Git stops showing matched files in `git status` output. You should add and commit the `.gitignore` file itself — it's part of your project configuration and others working with the repository need it too.

```bash
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Add .gitignore with common patterns"
```

::: {.callout-tip}
Add a `.gitignore` early in your project, ideally before your first commit. It's much easier to keep unwanted files out of the repository from the start than to remove them later.
:::

## Practice exercise

This exercise walks through the full workflow covered in this tutorial. You'll create a small project, make commits, inspect history, and undo a change. Each step shows the command and what to expect.

**1. Create a project directory and initialize Git:**

```bash
mkdir git-practice
cd git-practice
git init
```

```text
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/you/git-practice/.git/
```

**2. Create two files with some content:**

```bash
echo "Meeting notes from Feb 6" > notes.txt
echo "# Quarterly Report" > report.qmd
```

**3. Check the status:**

```bash
git status
```

```text
On branch main

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        notes.txt
        report.qmd

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

Both files are untracked — Git sees them but isn't recording their changes yet.

**4. Stage and commit both files:**

```bash
git add notes.txt report.qmd
git commit -m "Add initial notes and report"
```

```text
[main (root-commit) 1a2b3c4] Add initial notes and report
 2 files changed, 2 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 notes.txt
 create mode 100644 report.qmd
```

**5. Create a new file and modify an existing one:**

```bash
echo "id,value" > data.csv
echo "- Discussed project timeline" >> notes.txt
```

**6. Check the status again:**

```bash
git status
```

```text
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   notes.txt

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        data.csv

no changes added to commit (use "git add" to track)
```

Git shows `notes.txt` as modified and `data.csv` as untracked.

**7. Stage both files selectively and commit:**

```bash
git add notes.txt data.csv
git commit -m "Add meeting discussion notes and data file"
```

**8. View the log:**

```bash
git log --oneline
```

```text
7e8f9a0 Add meeting discussion notes and data file
1a2b3c4 Add initial notes and report
```

Two commits, listed newest first — the timeline of your project so far.

**9. Make an unwanted edit, then undo it:**

```bash
echo "MISTAKE - delete this line" >> report.qmd
git diff
```

```diff
diff --git a/report.qmd b/report.qmd
index 3b18e51..a4c2d8e 100644
--- a/report.qmd
+++ b/report.qmd
@@ -1 +1,2 @@
 # Quarterly Report
+MISTAKE - delete this line
```

You can see the unwanted addition. Discard it:

```bash
git restore report.qmd
```

**10. Verify everything is clean:**

```bash
git status
```

```text
On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

```bash
git log --oneline
```

```text
7e8f9a0 Add meeting discussion notes and data file
1a2b3c4 Add initial notes and report
```

Your history is intact, and the unwanted edit is gone. You've used the full Git workflow: init, status, add, commit, log, diff, and restore.
