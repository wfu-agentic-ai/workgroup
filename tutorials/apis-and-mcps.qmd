## Overview

APIs let you access AI models and other services programmatically. MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers extend what AI assistants like Claude Code can do by connecting them to external tools and data sources. This tutorial covers the fundamentals of APIs, how to manage keys securely, and how to set up MCP servers.

**Prerequisites:** [Claude Code introduction](claude-code-intro.qmd)

## What is an API?

The request/response model. An analogy: APIs as a waiter between you and a kitchen. REST basics: endpoints, HTTP methods, JSON responses. Why APIs matter for AI tools.

## API keys

### What is an API key?

A unique string that identifies you to a service. Like a password, but for programs.

### Getting an API key

Creating an Anthropic account. Generating a key from the dashboard. Usage limits and billing.

### Storing keys securely

Why you should never put keys in code or commit them to Git. Environment variables as the standard approach.

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
```

Adding the export to your shell config (but *not* to version-controlled files). Using `.env` files and `.gitignore`.

::: {.callout-warning}
If you accidentally commit an API key, revoke it immediately and generate a new one. Leaked keys can be used by anyone.

## Using the Anthropic API

### A simple request with `curl`

Sending a prompt to the Claude API from the command line.

```bash
curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \
  -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -d '{"model":"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929","max_tokens":256,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}]}'
```

### Reading the JSON response

What the response object looks like. Extracting the text content.

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol — a standard for connecting AI assistants to external tools. What MCP servers provide: database access, file search, web browsing, specialized APIs. How Claude Code discovers and uses MCP tools.

## Setting up an MCP server

### Installation

Installing an MCP server package (example: filesystem server, web search).

### Configuration

Where MCP config lives. The `~/.claude/` settings directory. Specifying which servers to use.

### Verification

Testing that Claude Code can see and use the MCP tools.

## Available MCP servers

A curated list of useful MCP servers for academic workflows. File system tools, web search, document readers, database connectors.

## Security and ethics

### Rate limits

Understanding usage caps. Monitoring your consumption.

### Data privacy

What data gets sent to the API. Institutional data policies. Sensitive data considerations.

### Institutional policy

WFU guidelines for AI tool usage. Responsible use in academic contexts.
