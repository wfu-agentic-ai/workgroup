## Summary

### Exploring Claude Code Together

The group met to discuss their goals and familiarity with Claude and Claude
Code. Will, Shannon, Hasan, David, Raina, Jo, and Andre shared their
backgrounds and reasons for joining the group. Will explained his
excitement about learning Claude Code and his goal to create formatted
exams. The group discussed their diverse interests in using Claude Code for
tasks like data analysis, file organization, and creating formatted
documents. They agreed to explore Claude Code together, with Will leading a
collective exploration session.

### Claude Code Setup and Integration

The group discussed setting up Claude Code, with Shannon providing guidance
to Raina on installing necessary command line tools. Will clarified that
using Claude Code would consume the user's existing Claude subscription
unless they use a paid token key. Jerid joined the meeting and shared his
background in linguistics and cognitive science, explaining his interest in
Claude Code due to its compatibility with his terminal-based workflow. He
described his experience with earlier tools like ADER and highlighted
Claude Code's evolution to become more user-friendly, while warning against
other autonomous AI tools like Moltbot and Open Claw.

### Claude Code Integration and Automation

Jerid discussed the new features of Claude Code, emphasizing its ability to
provide feedback, control interactions, and suggest continuations for
chats. He explained how APIs, like those for Canvas and Workday, can be
used to automate tasks and integrate with systems, though there are
permission restrictions. Raina expressed interest in using Claude Code to
streamline the creation and upload of Canvas LMS packages, as she finds the
current process tedious. Jerid also touched on the use of Git for version
control, allowing users to track and revert changes in projects over time.

### Claude Code Installation Process Overview

The group discussed the installation process of Claude Code, focusing on
the technical requirements and challenges faced by different operating
systems. Jerid explained the [educational plan benefits for educators](https://github.com/education), which
include private GitHub access and AI model usage. Will shared his
experience with the installation process, mentioning the need for
additional tools like Git and Node.js, and noted the time required to
complete the setup. The team also discussed the potential for creating a
guide or website to document the process for future reference.

### Claude Code Installation Setup Guide

The team discussed the installation process for Claude Code, emphasizing
the importance of having a terminal window open and ensuring that node.js
and collab.code are installed. Will guided the group through the necessary
steps, including restarting the terminal to test the installation. Mason,
who was catching up, introduced himself as a quantitative psychologist
teaching a Data Science course and mentioned his expertise in large
language models. The session aimed to help everyone get started with the
setup, with some members already familiar with the process and others
catching up.

### Claude Installation and Setup Guide

The team discussed the installation and setup of Claude, with Will guiding
others through the process. Shannon and Will confirmed they had
successfully installed the version number, while Jo faced some errors due
to missing software and needed to install Git and Node.js. Jo planned to
resolve the issues later, and Will shared that he had overcome similar
installation challenges by restarting the terminal, installing necessary
software, and adding it to the system path. The team also discussed using
the terminal to run Claude within specific folders, with Will suggesting
this method for ease of use.

### Terminal Navigation and Commands

Will and Jerid discussed [navigating file paths and directories using
terminal commands on different operating systems](../tutorials/working-with-the-filesystem.qmd). They explained how to
copy folder paths on Mac and Windows (from the Finder or Explorer), use the `cd` command to change
directories, and run Claude in terminal. Will shared his excitement about
using the Claude Code `/init` command (see [Anthropic Docs for more](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/interactive-mode#built-in-commands)), which led to an unexpected and impressive
outcome that he wanted to share with others.

### Claude Integration and Data Security

The group discussed integrating Claude with a Data Science repository and the
challenges of using Git with Google Drive syncing. Jerid advised Raina to
experiment with Claude in a sandbox environment rather than syncing it with
Google Drive initially, due to potential sync issues. Raina raised concerns
about data security with LLMs, and Jerid mentioned that Claude Code the tool
operates locally on users' computers, however all LLM traffic is routed through
Anthropic servers. Shannon had to leave for class but planned to experiment
further and coordinate the next meeting's schedule.

### Claude Code Privacy and Security

The group discussed the privacy and security implications of using Claude
Code, with Jerid explaining that data is not stored locally and emphasizing
the importance of understanding terminal interactions and directory
management. Will and David mentioned their enterprise agreements with
Microsoft Copilot for data security, while Raina and others shared approaches like
anonymizing data before inputting it into LLMs. The conversation ended with
a discussion about future meeting formats, with Will asking whether
in-person or Zoom meetings would be more productive, leaving the decision
open for group preference.

### In-Person and Virtual Meeting Plans

The group discussed meeting logistics and decided to hold the next session
in person, with a mix of in-person and virtual meetings going forward. They
agreed to schedule two weekly sessions to accommodate everyone's
availability, with Will creating a calendar invite for the next meeting on
Friday. Jerid suggested using a research methods room with a projector for
future in-person meetings. Jo offered to help Will set up a Google group
for better organization, and the group agreed to use this method for
communication.

### Cloud Code Collaboration Platform Launch

The group discussed creating a collaborative platform for learning about
Cloud Code, with Jerid offering to set up a GitHub organization and website
using Quarto to host articles and programming tips. They agreed to combine
both GitHub and Google Group approaches, with Will handling the calendar
and Google group coordination. The team debated potential names for the
GitHub organization, with suggestions including "WFU Claude" and "WFU
Agentic AI," though they decided to let Claude generate a suggestion. Will
committed to sharing the meeting summary and to-dos with interested
participants within 24 hours.
